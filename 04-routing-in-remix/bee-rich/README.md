# 4. Routing in Remix

This chapter introduces you to routing in Remix. You will learn how to add standalone pages, nested routes, and dynamic routes to your app. Additionally, you will learn about index routes and pathless layout routes. You will also practice working with Remix's page navigation states.

## Getting started

In the previous chapter, you were introduced to BeeRich - the demo app for this book. To get started with this chapter, you can pick up the code where you left off.

You can find the solution code from the previous chapter [here](../../03-deployment-targets-adapters-and-stacks/bee-rich/).

If you get stuck while working on _Chapter 4, Routing in Remix_, you can review the final solution code for this chapter [here](./solution/).

Happy coding!

### Run the application

To run the application, you need to install the dependencies and start the development server:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server on port `3000`. You can now open the application in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Great! You are now ready to start working on _Chapter 4, Routing in Remix_! Dive into the world of routing in Remix!
