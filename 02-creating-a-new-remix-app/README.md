# 2. Creating a new Remix App

In this chapter, we create our first Remix apps using the `create-remix` CLI. First, we create a simple "Hello World!" app. Then, we create an app using the Express.js template and learn about templates in Remix. This chapter also introduces a troubleshooting guide that will help us debug Remix applications.

## Technical requirements

To follow along, you will need a computer that can run Node.js. All common operation systems should suffice. Please install both Node.js (version 18 or higher) and npm on your machine. An editor such as VS Code is recommended.

You can download Node.js and npm here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
