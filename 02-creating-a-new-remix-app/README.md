# 2. Creating a new Remix App

In this chapter, we create our first Remix apps using the `create-remix` CLI. First, we create a simple "Hello World!" app. Then, we create an app using the Express.js template and learn about templates in Remix. This chapter also introduces a troubleshooting guide that will help us debug Remix applications.

## Using the Express.js template

This folder also includes an [Express.js project](./express-js/), bootstrapped using the `create-remix` CLI.
