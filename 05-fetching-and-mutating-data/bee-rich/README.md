# 5. Fetching and Mutating Data

In this chapter, you will learn how to fetch and mutate data in Remix. We already set up a routing hierarchy in the previous chapter that we will now fill with functionality.

## Getting started

Please note that the code in the [start](./start/) folder of this chapter is different from our final [solution](/05-fetching-and-mutating-data/bee-rich/solution/) from _Chapter 4, Routing in Remix_. For the start of this chapter, we set up Prisma with SQLite to store our data in a database.

If you want to reuse the code from the previous chapter, then follow this guide to get to the starting point of this chapter. Otherwise, feel free to checkout the code in the [start](./start/) folder and dive right into _Chapter 5, Fetching and Mutating Data_.

### Run the application

To run the application, you will first need to follow the steps in the [Setting up Prisma with SQLite](#setting-up-prisma-with-sqlite) section below. After that, you should be all set.

In case you want to use the [start code](./start) instead, follow these steps to get your application up and running:

1. Make sure you have a `.env` file in the root of your project and that it contains the following line:

```text
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
```

2. Install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

3. Generate the Prisma client

```bash
npm run build
```

4. Update the SQLite database schema

```bash
npm run update:db
```

5. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the development server on port `3000`. You can now open the application in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

In case you receive Prisma errors during build, schema update, or runtime, you can reset the database by running the following command:

```bash
npm run reset:db
```

6. Seed the database with test data

```bash
npm run seed
```

This is optional, but can be helpful for testing. You can also alter the seed data that is being generated by making changes to the code in `prisma/seed.ts`. Note that with the current setup, you can only seed the database once. After that, `npm run seed` will fail on the unique email constraint during the test user creation.

## Setting up Prisma with SQLite

Prisma is a database toolkit that is popular with the Remix community. In this chapter, we will use Prisma to add a SQLite database to BeeRich. SQLite is a file-based database that is easy to set up and use.

The code of _Chapter 5_ has Prisma already set up. If you want to add Prisma to your own project (e.g. the code of _Chapter 4_), you can follow the following steps:

1. **Install the Prisma CLI as a development dependency in your project**

```bash
npm install prisma --save-dev
```

2. **Install the Prisma client as a dependency in your project**

```bash
npm install @prisma/client
```

3. **Initialize Prisma**

```bash
npx prisma init --datasource-provider sqlite
```

This will add both a `prisma` folder and a `.env` file to your project. The `.env` file contains the database connection string used by Prisma: `DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"`.

Please note that the `.env` file is ignored by git based on our `.gitignore` file. This is a good practice to keep your credentials out of version control.

4. **(Optional) Get the Prisma VSCode extension**

You can find the extension in the [VSCode marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.prisma).

5. **Add helpful scripts to your `package.json`**

```json
"scripts": {
  "format:db": "npx prisma format",
  "build:db": "npx prisma generate",
  "update:db": "npx prisma db push",
  "seed": "npx tsx prisma/seed.ts",
  "reset:db": "rimraf ./prisma/dev.db && npm run update:db && npm run seed"
}
```

- `format:db` formats the Prisma schema file
- `build:db` generates the Prisma client
- `update:db` updates the database schema of the SQLite database
- `seed` seeds the database with some initial mock data
- `reset:db` deletes the database by removing the `dev.db` file and then recreates it by running `update:db` and `seed`

6. **Update `.gitignore` to ignore the SQLite database file**

Add the following line to your `.gitignore` and `.eslintignore` files:

```txt
/prisma/dev.db
```

7. **Model the data**

Add the following two data models to the `schema.prisma` file:

```prisma
model Expense {
  id           String   @id @default(uuid())
  title        String
  description  String?
  amount       Float
  currencyCode String
  createdAt    DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt    DateTime @updatedAt
}

model Invoice {
  id           String   @id @default(uuid())
  title        String
  description  String?
  amount       Float
  currencyCode String
  createdAt    DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt    DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

Each model has an `id` field that is the primary key of the table. The `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields are automatically managed by Prisma.

Having some questions? Please find more information in the [Prisma quick-start guide](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/quickstart). You can learn more about SQLite and Prisma [here](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/database-connectors/sqlite).

8. **Update the database schema**

Run the following commands to update the database schema and generate the Prisma client:

```bash
npm run build:db && npm run update:db
```

9. **Create a new folder `app/modules`**

Create a `modules` folder in `app`. We will use this folder to organize new features in our application.

10. **Create a wrapper for the Prisma client**

Usually you can import the Prisma client directly from `@prisma/client`. However, for it to work with Remix in development, we need to add a wrapper that stores the client in a cached variable.

Create a new file `db.server.ts` in `app/modules` and add the following code:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

let db: PrismaClient;

declare global {
  // eslint-disable-next-line no-var
  var __db: PrismaClient | undefined;
}

// this is needed because in development we don't want to restart
// the server with every change, but we want to make sure we don't
// create a new connection to the DB with every change either.
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  db = new PrismaClient();
} else {
  if (!global.__db) {
    global.__db = new PrismaClient();
  }
  db = global.__db;
}

export { db };

```

You can find more information about this wrapper in the database section of the [Remix Jokes App Tutorial](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/tutorials/jokes#connect-to-the-database).

11. **Seed the database**

Create a new file `seed.ts` in the `prisma` folder and add the following code:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

const db = new PrismaClient();

const expenses = [

  },
];

const income = [
  {
    title: 'Salary December',
    amount: 2500,
    currencyCode: 'USD',
    date: '2022-12-30',
  },
  {

  {
    title: 'Salary October',
    amount: 2500,
    currencyCode: 'USD',
    date: '2022-10-30',
  },
  {
    title: 'Salary September',
    amount: 2500,
    currencyCode: 'USD',
    date: '2022-09-30',
  },
];

function createExpense(expenseData: (typeof expenses)[number]) {
  return db.expense.create({
    data: {
      title: expenseData.title,
      amount: expenseData.amount,
      currencyCode: expenseData.currencyCode,
      createdAt: new Date(expenseData.date),
    },
  });
}

function createInvoice(incomeData: (typeof income)[number]) {
  return db.invoice.create({
    data: {
      title: incomeData.title,
      amount: incomeData.amount,
      currencyCode: incomeData.currencyCode,
      createdAt: new Date(incomeData.date),
    },
  });
}

console.log('ðŸŒ± Seeding the database...');
const start = performance.now();
const expensePromises = expenses.map((expense) => createExpense(expense));
const invoicePromises = income.map((income) => createInvoice(income));
await Promise.all([...expensePromises, ...invoicePromises]);
const end = performance.now();
console.log(`ðŸš€ Seeded the database. Done in ${Math.round(end - start)}ms`);

```

This script is used to seed the database with sample data. We can execute the script by running the following command:

```bash
npm run seed
```

- Run `npm run seed` anytime you want to add the sample data to the database.
- If you want to reset your database, use `npm run reset:db` to reset and seed the database.

**Great!** ðŸ¥³ We are all set to use Prisma in our project! ðŸŽ‰

### Hosting environment considerations

Please note that a SQLite database requires write access to the filesystem. This can be problematic in some serverless environments. In this case, you may want to use a different database.

Luckily, switching to a different database is easy with Prisma. You can find more information about this in the [Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/database-connectors).
