# 8. Session Management

In this chapter, you will learn about session management in Remix. First, we will use the URL to store application state. Next, we will utilize cookies to manage user sessions. Finally, we will see how to authenticate users with session cookies.

## Getting started

Note that the code in the [start](./start/) folder of this chapter is different from our final [solution](/7-error-handling-in-remix/bee-rich/solution/) from _Chapter 7, Error Handling in Remix_.

If you want to reuse the code from the previous chapter, then follow the following guide to get to the starting point of this chapter. Otherwise, feel free to checkout the code in the [start](./start/) folder and dive right into _Chapter 8, Session Management_.

## Adding users to our database model

Happy coding!
