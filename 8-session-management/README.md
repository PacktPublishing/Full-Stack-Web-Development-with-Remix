# 8. Session Management

In this chapter, you will learn about session management in Remix. First, we will use the URL to store application state. Next, we will utilize cookies to manage user sessions. Finally, we will see how to authenticate users with session cookies.

## Getting started

Note that the code in the [start](./start/) folder of this chapter is different from our final [solution](/7-error-handling-in-remix/bee-rich/solution/) from _Chapter 7, Error Handling in Remix_.

If you want to reuse the code from the previous chapter, then follow the following guide to get to the starting point of this chapter. Otherwise, feel free to checkout the code in the [start](./start/) folder and dive right into _Chapter 8, Session Management_.

## Introducing users to BeeRich

So, far we don't have a concept of users in BeeRich. To change that, let's first update our database model.

1. **Add a `User` model to the database schema**

Add the following `User` model to the `/prisma/schema.prisma` file:

```prisma
model User {
  id        String   @id @default(uuid())
  email     String   @unique
  name      String
  password  String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  expenses  Expense[]
  invoices  Invoice[]
}
```

Each user can have multiple expenses and invoices associated to them. In Prisma, we model this through a [one-to-many relation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations/one-to-many-relations) between the `User` and the `Expense` and `Invoice` models.

2. **Add a reference to a user to the `Expense` and `Invoice` models**

We also have to update the `Expense` and `Invoice` models to specify that each expense and invoice is associated to a specific user.

Add the following two fields to both the `Expense` and `Invoice` models:

```prisma
  user         User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  userId       String
```

We add a `userId` field to both the `Expense` and `Invoice` model. The `userId` field specifies that each expense and invoice is associated with exactly one user.

The `@relation` definition is used to specify the relation between the `User` and `Expense` and `Invoice` models. In the `Expense` and `Invoice` models, the `userId` field is used as the foreign key to refer to the `User` model. The `userId` field points to the `id` field of the `User` model. We also specify that on deletion of the user object, all referenced expenses and invoices should be deleted as well (cascade).

3. **Build the new database schema**

Run `npm run build:db` to create the new database model.

Make sure to run `npm i` before running `npm run build` if you haven't already.

4. **Install bcryptjs**

Now that we store user passwords in our database, we must ensure that they are not stored in plain text. To do so, we will use the [bcryptjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs) package.

Run `npm i bcryptjs` to install the package.

Next, run `npm install --save-dev @types/bcryptjs` to install the TypeScript types for the package.

5. **Update the seed script**

Let's also update the `/prisma/seed.ts` script. Every expense and invoice object in our database now requires a reference to a user.

First, let's import `bcryptjs` and the `User` type from Prisma:

```diff
+import type { User } from '@prisma/client';
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
+import bcrypt from 'bcryptjs';
```

Next, update the seed function to first create a test user. Feel free to update the user mock data to whatever you like:

```diff
async function seed() {
  const start = performance.now();
+ const user = await db.user.create({
+   data: {
+     name: 'John Doe',
+     email: 'john.doe@example.com',
+     password: await bcrypt.hash('BeeRich', 10),
+   },
+ });
+ const expensePromises = expenses.map((expense) => createExpense(expense, user));
+ const invoicePromises = income.map((income) => createInvoice(income, user));
  await Promise.all([...expensePromises, ...invoicePromises]);
  const end = performance.now();
  console.log(`ðŸš€ Seeded the database. Done in ${Math.round(end - start)}ms`);
}
```

The updated `seed` function creates a mock user. It then passed the mock user as the second argument to the `createExpense` and `createInvoice` helper functions.

Update the `createExpense` and `createInvoice` helper functions to accept a user object. Update the creation query to connect the created expense and invoice objects to the user:

```diff
+function createExpense(expenseData: typeof expenses[number], user: User) {
  return db.expense.create({
    data: {
      title: expenseData.title,
      amount: expenseData.amount,
      currencyCode: expenseData.currencyCode,
      createdAt: new Date(expenseData.date),
+     userId: user.id,
    },
  });
}

+function createInvoice(incomeData: typeof income[number], user: User) {
  return db.invoice.create({
    data: {
      title: incomeData.title,
      amount: incomeData.amount,
      currencyCode: incomeData.currencyCode,
      createdAt: new Date(incomeData.date),
+     userId: user.id,
    },
  });
}
```

6. **Reset the database**

Now that we updated the seed script, it's time to commit the changes to our database schema to our dev database.

The easiest way to do so is to delete the existing database.

Run `npm run reset:db` to execute our reset script. It will delete the dev database, create a new one, and call the seed script.

6. **Start the dev server**

Run `npm run dev`, open a new browser window, and navigate to the dashboard (`http://localhost:3000/dashboard`).

BeeRich should run without issues and the dashboard should display all expenses created with `seed.ts`.

**Great!** ðŸ¥³ We are all set to use the `User` model in our project! ðŸŽ‰

It's time to start _Chapter 8, Session Management_!
