# Full-Stack-Web-Development-with-Remix

Learn how Remix can supercharge your React development.

## Structure

Each folder contains the final code of a chapter. For example, `2-creating-a-new-remix-app` contains the final code of the second chapter "Creating a new Remix App".

Each chapter provides instructions for how to get started and how to incrementally reach the final code.

Starting with chapter 3, the code of the previous chapter is used as a starting point for the next chapter. For example, the code of chapter 4 is based on the code of chapter 3.
