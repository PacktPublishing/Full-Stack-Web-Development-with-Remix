## Structure

The code for each chapter can be found in the corresponding folder. For example, `02-creating-a-new-remix-app` contains the code for _Chapter 2, Creating a new Remix App_. Each chapter of the book provides instructions for how to get started and how to incrementally reach the final code of the chapter.

## BeeRich

BeeRich is a dashboard-like application that mimics both personal and enterprise use cases. BeeRich is a personal finance management application that helps you stay on top of your bee - pardon me - bookkeeping. Well, at least thatâ€™s the goal. In every chapter, we will add more code to this application.

We kick off the BeeRich development journey in _Chapter 3, Deployment Targets, Adapters, and Stacks_. You can find the BeeRich Remix template [here](/03-deployment-targets-adapters-and-stacks/bee-rich/).

### Getting started with BeeRich

Run the following command in a terminal to bootstrap the application:

```sh
npx create-remix@2 --template PacktPublishing/Full-Stack-Web-Development-with-Remix/03-deployment-targets-adapters-and-stacks/bee-rich
```

Follow the instructions in the terminal to create the application.

Note that the created application is nothing but a copy of the template from _Chapter 3, Deployment Targets, Adapters, and Stacks_. Refer to the `README.md` file in the bootstrapped application folder or [here](./03-deployment-targets-adapters-and-stacks/bee-rich/README.md) for more information about how to work with BeeRich.
