# Full-Stack-Web-Development-with-Remix

Learn how Remix can supercharge your React development.

## Structure

The code for each chapter can be found in the corresponding folder. For example, `2-creating-a-new-remix-app` contains the code for _Chapter 2, Creating a new Remix App_.

Each chapter provides instructions for how to get started and how to incrementally reach the final code. The best starting point is the `README.md` file in each folder. The structure of each chapter may vary, but starting in [chapter 4](4-routing-in-remix/) you will typically find a `start` and a `solution` folder. The `start` folder contains the code that you will start with. The `solution` folder contains the code that you will end up with.

Sometimes the `README.md` file may include instructions from how to get from the previous chapter's final solution to the current chapter's starting point.
