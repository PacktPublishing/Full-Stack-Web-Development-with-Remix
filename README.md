## Structure

The code for each chapter can be found in the corresponding folder. For example, `02-creating-a-new-remix-app` contains the code for _Chapter 2, Creating a new Remix App_. Each chapter of the book provides instructions for how to get started and how to incrementally reach the final code of the chapter.

## BeeRich

BeeRich is a dashboard-like application that mimics both personal and enterprise use cases. BeeRich is a personal finance management application that helps you stay on top of your bee - pardon me - bookkeeping. Well, at least thatâ€™s the goal. In every chapter, we will add more code to this application.

We kick off the BeeRich development journey in _Chapter 3, Deployment Targets, Adapters, and Stacks_. You can find the BeeRich Remix template [here](/03-deployment-targets-adapters-and-stacks/bee-rich/).

### Getting started with BeeRich

Run the following command in a terminal to bootstrap the application:

```sh
npx create-remix@2 --template PacktPublishing/Full-Stack-Web-Development-with-Remix/03-deployment-targets-adapters-and-stacks/bee-rich
```

Follow the instructions in the terminal to create the application.

Note that the created application is nothing but a copy of the template from _Chapter 3, Deployment Targets, Adapters, and Stacks_. Refer to the `README.md` file in the bootstrapped application folder or [here](./03-deployment-targets-adapters-and-stacks/bee-rich/README.md) for more information about how to work with BeeRich.

## Troubleshooting and FAQ

### Application Error! How do I fix it?

If you see an **Application Error** while running the application, it is most likely that you missed a step in the instructions. Refer to the troubleshooting section in _Chapter 2, Creating a new Remix App_, for a step-by-step guide on how to debug issues in Remix. As always, read carefully through the error message and the stack trace to find the root cause of the issue.

#### Error: Environment variable not found: DATABASE_URL

1. Make sure to add an `.env` file to the root of your project. Refer to the `README.md` file of your current chapter. The _Run the application_ section contains the required environment variables for the application to run.
2. Restart your application after adding the `.env` file by running `npm run dev`. Environment variables are only loaded when the application starts.
