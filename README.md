## Structure

The code for each chapter can be found in the corresponding folder. For example, `02-creating-a-new-remix-app` contains the code for _Chapter 2, Creating a new Remix App_. Each chapter of the book provides instructions for how to get started and how to incrementally reach the final code of the chapter.

## BeeRich

In this book, we build a demo application called BeeRich. BeeRich is a dashboard-like expense and income tracking application. It is meant to reflect a real-world application that you might build with Remix.

We kick off our BeeRich development journey in [Chapter 3](/03-deployment-targets-adapters-and-stacks/bee-rich/).

### Getting started with BeeRich

Run the following command in a terminal to bootstrap the application, using the template from Chapter 3:

```sh
npx create-remix@2 --template PacktPublishing/Full-Stack-Web-Development-with-Remix/03-deployment-targets-adapters-and-stacks/bee-rich
```

Refer to the README.md file in the bootstrapped application folder for more information about how to work with BeeRich.
