# 7. Error Handling in Remix

In this chapter, you will learn about error handling in Remix. We will work with Remix's `ErrorBoundary` and `CatchBoundary` components to handle errors in a declarative way. We will also revisit the concept of throwing responses in loader and action functions.

## Getting started

You can start right where you left off and use the code from the previous chapter to get started with _Chapter 7, Error Handling in Remix_.

- If you want to start from scratch, you can find the [solution code from the previous chapter](../../3-deployment-targets-adapters-and-stacks/bee-rich/).
- If you are stuck or need a hint, check the [solution code for this chapter](./solution/).

Happy coding!
