## Getting started

In the previous chapter you were introduced to BeeRich. You can start right where you left off and use the code from the previous chapter to get started with _Chapter 4, Routing in Remix_.

- If you want to start from scratch, use the [solution code from the previous chapter](../../3-deployment-targets-adapters-and-stacks/bee-rich/).
- If you are stuck or need a hint, check the [solution code for this chapter](./solution/).
