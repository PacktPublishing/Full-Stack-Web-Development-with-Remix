# 5. Fetching and Mutating Data

In this chapter, you will learn how to fetch and mutate data in Remix. You will further be introduced to Remix's revalidation and progressive enhancement capabilities. Next, we will practice implementing optimistic UIs. We will also cover resource routes that can act as API and webhook endpoints.

## Getting started

In the previous chapter we learned about routing Remix. We already set up an extensive routing hierarchy that we will now fill with functionality.

Please note that the code in the [start](./start/) folder in this chapter contains is different from our final solution from _Chapter 4, Routing in Remix_. We set up Prisma with SQLite to store our data in a database.

If you want to reuse the code from the previous chapter, then follow the following guide to get to the starting point of this chapter. Otherwise, feel free to checkout the code in the [start](./start/) folder and dive right into _Chapter 5, Fetching and Mutating Data_.

## Setting up Prisma with SQLite

Prisma is a database toolkit that is popular with the Remix community. In this chapter, we will use Prisma to add a SQLite database to BeeRich. SQLite is a file-based database that is easy to set up and use.

The code of _Chapter 5_ has Prisma already set up. If you want to add Prisma to your own project (e.g. the code of _Chapter 4_), you can follow the following steps:

1. **Install the Prisma CLI as a development dependency in your project:**

```bash
npm install prisma --save-dev
```

2. **Initialize Prisma:**

```bash
npx prisma init --datasource-provider sqlite
```

This will add both a `prisma` folder and a `.env` file to your project. The `.env` file contains the database connection string used by Prisma.

3. **(Optional) Get the Prisma VSCode extension:**

You can find the extension in the [VSCode marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.prisma).

4. **Add helpful scripts to your `package.json`:**

```json
"scripts": {
    "format:db": "npx prisma format",
    "build:db": "npx prisma generate",
    "update:db": "npx prisma db push",
    "reset:db": "npx prisma db reset"
}
```

- `format:db` formats the Prisma schema file
- `build:db` generates the Prisma client
- `update:db` updates the database schema of the SQLite database
- `reset:db` resets the database by dropping all tables and recreating them

5. **Update `.gitignore` to ignore the SQLite database file:**

```
/prisma/dev.db
```

6. **Model the data:**

Add the following two data models to the `schema.prisma` file:

```prisma
model Expense {
  id          Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  title       String
  description String
  amount      Decimal
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
}

model Invoice {
  id          Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  title       String
  description String
  amount      Decimal
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

Each model has an `id` field that is the primary key of the table. The `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields are automatically managed by Prisma.

Having some questions? Please find more information in the [Prisma quick-start guide](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/quickstart). You can learn more about SQLite and Prisma [here](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/database-connectors/sqlite).

7. **Update the database schema:**

Run the following commands to update the database schema and generate the Prisma client:

```bash
npm run build:db && npm run update:db
```

8. **Create a wrapper for the Prisma client:**

Usually you can import the Prisma client directly from `@prisma/client`. However, for it to work with Remix in development, we need to add a wrapper that stores the client in a cached variable.

Create a new file `db.server.ts` in the `app` folder and add the following code:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

let db: PrismaClient;

declare global {
  // eslint-disable-next-line no-var
  var __db: PrismaClient | undefined;
}

// this is needed because in development we don't want to restart
// the server with every change, but we want to make sure we don't
// create a new connection to the DB with every change either.
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
  db = new PrismaClient();
} else {
  if (!global.__db) {
    global.__db = new PrismaClient();
  }
  db = global.__db;
}

export { db };
```

You can find more information about this wrapper in the database section of the [Remix Jokes App Tutorial](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/tutorials/jokes#connect-to-the-database).

Great! ðŸ¥³ We are all set to use Prisma in our project! ðŸŽ‰

### Hosting environment considerations

Please note that a SQLite database requires write access to the filesystem. This can be problematic in some serverless environments. In this case, you may want to use a different database.

Luckily, switching to a different database is easy with Prisma. You can find more information about this in the [Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/database-connectors).
